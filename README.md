# Mushare

An android application which allows a person to share their music with everyone else when dining in a restaurant. Suppose you go to a restaurant and do not like the music that is playing or maybe love it so much that you just have to add it to your playlist. Well this app will let you add you personal favourite songs to a common playlist and also dislike/downvote a song that you don't like. In addition, all you have to do to connect is scan the QR-Code!
